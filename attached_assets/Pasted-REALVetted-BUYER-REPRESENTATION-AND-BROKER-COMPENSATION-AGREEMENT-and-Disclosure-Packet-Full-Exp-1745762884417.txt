REALVetted - BUYER REPRESENTATION AND BROKER COMPENSATION
AGREEMENT and Disclosure Packet: Full Explanation Guide:
This document serves as a full, line-by-line explanation of each mandatory disclosure form and
agreement required when working with a real estate broker under California law. It is designed to
educate buyers using the REALVetted platform, which offers guidance and transparency through
technology rather than traditional intermediaries. The following sections explain each document
included in the standard Buyer Representation and Broker Compensation Agreement (BRBC)
packet.
