/**
 * Test script for the client-side scraper implementation
 * 
 * This script demonstrates how to use the client-side scraper for Realtor.com
 * to avoid server-side scraping that gets blocked by anti-bot measures.

// Note: This script is meant to be run in a browser environment
// The actual implementation is in client/src/utils/clientScraper.ts
// A test UI is available at /tools/property-scraper

console.log('Client-side scraper test');
console.log('------------------------');
console.log('To test the client-side scraper:');
console.log('1. Log in to the application');
console.log('2. Navigate to /tools/property-scraper');
console.log('3. Enter a Realtor.com URL or a property URL from any real estate site');
console.log('4. Click "Extract" to test the client-side scraping functionality');
console.log('------------------------');
console.log('This hybrid approach offers three extraction methods:');
console.log('1. Direct client-side scraping for Realtor.com URLs');
console.log('2. Client-side scraping via a Realtor.com equivalent URL (for Zillow, etc.)');
console.log('3. Server-side fallback extraction for other cases');
